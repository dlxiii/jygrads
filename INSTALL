Installation in Matlab
----------------------

You need to run Matlab with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). You will
need the following files:

::
     grads.m
     examples.m
     jygrads-superpack.jar

Put *grads.m* in a place MATLAB can find it, say $HOME/.matlab; the script
*example.m* shows basic usage.

The Java archive *jygrads-superpack.jar* contains PyGrADS and the all
necessary Jython engine and packages. In order to use this Java
archive you need to set your *classpath.txt* file so that Matlab can
find it.

I suggest you set your static Java path. Quoting from the Malab FAQ:

   MATLAB loads the static class path from the classpath.txt file at
   the start of each session. The static path offers better class
   loading performance than the dynamic path. However, to modify the
   static path, you need to edit classpath.txt, and then restart
   MATLAB.

   *Finding and Editing classpath.txt.* The default classpath.txt file
   resides in the toolbox\local subdirectory of your MATLAB root
   directory matlabroot:

::
   [matlabroot '\toolbox\local\classpath.txt']
   ans = /opt/matlab/toolbox/local/classpath.txt

   To make changes in the static path that affect all users who share
   this same MATLAB root directory, edit this file in
   toolbox\local. If you want to make changes that do not affect
   anyone else, copy classpath.txt to your own startup directory and
   edit the file there. When MATLAB starts up, it looks for
   classpath.txt first in your startup directory, and then in the
   default location. It uses the first file it finds.

   To see which classpath.txt file is currently being used by your
   MATLAB environment, use the which function:

::
    >> which classpath.txt

    To edit either the default file or the copy in your own directory,
    type:

::
    >> edit classpath.txt

    All you need to do is to add a line at the end of your
    *classpath.txt* file with the full path name of your jygrads
    archive, e.g.,

::
    /home/joe/.matlab/jar/jygrads-superpack.jar

    IMPORTANT: MATLAB reads classpath.txt only at startup. If you edit
    classpath.txt or change your .class files while MATLAB is running,
    you must restart MATLAB to put those changes into effect.
